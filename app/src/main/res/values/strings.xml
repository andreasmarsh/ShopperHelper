    <string name="help_text">If you live with roommates, you may have to purchase items which are shared by everyone.
    It would be useful to have a common place for storing/shopping needs for such shared items, and then
    recording shopping expenses. This is the answer to all those wishes. Every roommate will
    have their own personal log in. Once logged in each roommate will be able to add items to shopping
    list and once purchased they will automatically move to the purchased list and add how much the item cost.
    Once items are in the purchased list you can select settle cost and the app with calculate how much
        every roommate has to pay. It\'s kinda like magic! </string>
